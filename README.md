# The emojART flutter app

This is the first flutter app I wrote, and it is published on the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojart/id1632243774) and the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navonapps.emojart) recently.

So basically what this app does is it helps you create pixel art with emojis, a.k.a. emoji art. With emojART, you can create emoji art by drawing on mobile device with emojis as brushes. You can copy and paste it on social media such as Facebook or Whatsapp. 

The app contains features such as saving, uploading, sharing, and downloading the emoji arts. Users can also save and like other people's artifacts. I used Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as the authentication and cloud database backend, and it supports Facebook, Google, and Apple ID login. Users can make in-app purchase or subscribe to an ads-free premium version of the app. I used the [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) SDK as my payment backend. 

I am sorry that I cannot share my code here. If any potential employer would like to see them to access my programming skills, you can contact me at louiskhchan@outlook.com


# Hi

I am currently looking for Flutter developer jobs (remote or near Toronto). I recently published a flutter app on the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojart/id1632243774) and the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navonapps.emojart). I found [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) a great framework to work with and would like to start a career with it. 

I was a university lecturer who taught cognitive psychology for 10+ years. While my primary duties might be conducting research and teaching classes, I often coded. The codes and demos below showcase my programming skills, which greatly facilitated my research and teaching duties.
